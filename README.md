HOW TO RUN COMPLETE PROJECT:
You will have to add the same JWT_SECRET in .env file of the Auth Server & Backend Server.
So the Auth Server can assign JWT to user at login and Backend Server can verify when fetching data.
You will have to run "npm install" in the root folder of all three servers to get the correct node_modules for all servers.
